# CTFD-OpenTicket
“CTFd plugin: Chat with admins, get answers fast ⚡”
Slide into the admin DMs (but make it professional 👀).
This plugin adds an in-challenge chat box where players can drop questions, ask for hints, or cry for help 🆘. Admins can reply in real-time, so no more lost tickets or slow email chains.

Think of it as Discord vibes, but built right into your CTF platform.
